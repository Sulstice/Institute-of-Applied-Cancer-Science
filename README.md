At the Institute of Applied Cancer Science at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center I was accepted to perform research on a special case of breast cancer. Although this research is classified I can however provide with you some useful insight! 

A little look at my setup

There was my hood with the smiley balloons and all it's endeavors. 

A lot of the instruments I used were state of the art ranging from Autocolumns, to HPLCs-LCMS, and Mass Directive Systems. 

My research was primarily focused on modifying an extant drug to improve liver clearance and also potentially increase the binding affinity of the drug. Using both a blend of experimental and computational highthroughput techniques we were able to contrive a pretty powerful therapeutic. 

And the story ends there......

Coming soon - Mass Direct Systems!
